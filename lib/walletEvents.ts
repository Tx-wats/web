 * next to it, and the new-contract gate reads the connection through a hook.
 * Each of them used to poll `window.freighter` once on mount and keep a private
 * copy of the answer, so disconnecting from one button left the others showing
 * a stale address and a stale "Connected" badge.
 *
 * Every connect/disconnect now funnels through `broadcastWalletChange`, which
 * updates the `localStorage` and `window` mirrors and notifies listeners with a
 * `txwatch:wallet` CustomEvent. `useWalletState` is the React binding for it.
